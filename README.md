# comp479-hw3-classification

These scripts are separated by type of model.


To run a model, type 'python3 src/`model`.py'

For each example:

'python3 src/classifier.py'

'python3 src/svm.py'

'python3 src/knn.py'

'python3 src/dummy_classifier.py'


Each model prints its performance on the dev sets and test set in addition to writing the predicted label vs correct label in a csv.
